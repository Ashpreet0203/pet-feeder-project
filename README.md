# Automated Pet Feeder Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the problem-solving process by designing an **automated pet feeder**.  
It was developed as part of the **University of Canberra – Introduction to IT (4478/8936)** assignment: *The Solving Problem Process*.  

The aim is to design a logical solution using analysis, flowcharts, and word-based coding, while exploring how AI tools and version control (GitHub) can enhance professional documentation and collaboration.

##  Repository Structure
- **/Step1_Analysis** – Problem analysis and requirements.  
- **/Step3_Flowchart** – Flowchart diagrams (PNG/PDF) representing system logic.  
- **/Step4_Word_Code** – Word-based code implementation with comments.  
- **/Step5_Test_Results** – Test scenarios, results, and refinements.

## Logic Summary
- Dispense food at scheduled times.  
- Check if the pet has already eaten before releasing more food.  
- Monitor food levels (conceptually via sensors) to prevent errors.  
- Provide flexibility for different feeding schedules.

##  Future Real-World Implementation
The design could be implemented using hardware such as:  
- **Arduino UNO** – main controller.  
- **Servo Motor** – to release food portions.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** – to measure remaining food levels.  
- **RTC Module (Real-Time Clock)** – to manage scheduled feeding times.  

This bridges the gap between theoretical logic and practical automation.
